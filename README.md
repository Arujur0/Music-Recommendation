# Music-Recommendation
A music recommendation system derived from facial emotions. Consists of a facial emotion detector constructed using a neural network and a recommendation system built using filtering methods.

## Introduction
This project is a facial emotion recognition project that uses deep learning techniques to recognize human emotions from facial expressions and use those emotions to generate accurate song recommendations. This project is split into two phases:
1. Facial Emotion Recognition: Accurately identify the seven basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise and neutral (calm) from facial images in real time.
2. Music Recommendation: Recommend songs from the Spotify API using the results of the facial emotion detection system.
